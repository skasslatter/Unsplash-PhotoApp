# Unsplash Photo App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
Before running the application, install the dependencies by running the following command: 
#### `npm install`

Create a .env file and add your API key for the Unsplash api: 
#### `REACT_APP_API_ACCESS_KEY = yourKey`

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

#### `npm start`

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser. The page will reload if you make edits.

## Goal:

#### Build a simple React app that allows viewing and interacting with a grid of curated photos from Unsplash

- [ ] Fork this repository into your Github account. If you do not have one, you can a free account as shown here: https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/signing-up-for-github/signing-up-for-a-new-github-account
- [ ] Create a new working branch to work on.
- [ ] Use `create-react-app` to set up a basic single-page React application as shown here: https://reactjs.org/docs/create-a-new-react-app.html#create-react-app. (NOTE: We will only focus on creating a single-page React application, so don't worry about the other sections on that page such as Next.js).
- [ ] Refer to the Unsplash API docs here to set up a developer account: https://unsplash.com/documentation.
- [ ] Display a grid of photos in your React app. Use the `GET /photos/curated` endpoint from the Unsplash API to get a set of curated images.
- [ ] The grid of photos should preserve the aspect ratio of the photos it's displaying, meaning it shouldn't crop the image in any way.
- [ ] The grid should be responsive, and should work in both portrait and landscape orientations on both mobile and desktop browsers.
- [ ] You're free to use existing open source React components or Javascript packages/libraries from npm to complete this task.
- [ ] Once you are ready to share your code, you should push it to your forked repo and create Pull Request to the original repo (main branch). (You can read more about the process in this blog: https://akrabat.com/the-beginners-guide-to-contributing-to-a-github-project/)
### Evaluation:
- [ ] The React app should build without errors (typically using `npm run build`). If there are necessary steps required to get it to compile, those should be covered in README.md.
- [ ] No crashes or bugs.
- [ ] App should operate as a single-page application, without the need for a custom back-end.
- [ ] Code is easily understood and communicative (eg. comments, variable names, etc).
- [ ] GitHub commit history is consistent, easy to follow and understand.
